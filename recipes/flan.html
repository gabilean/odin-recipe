    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        "Flan" can refer to a couple different things depending on where you live. 
        In this case, it's a baked custard dessert topped with caramel. 
        The Spanish dessert is similar to the French crème caramel.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar for caramel - 1/2 cup (100 g)</li>
        <li>Sugar for flan - 1/2 cup (100 g)</li>
        <li>Eggs - 5</li>
        <li>Vanilla - 1/2 Tbsp.</li>
        <li>Milk - 2 cups (500 mL), warm</li> 
        <li>Dulce de leche or whipped cream - as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            For the Caramel: In a skillet, add a little of the sugar. 
            As the sugar starts to melt, stir with a wooden spoon. 
            Add a little more sugar, and continue to stir. 
            Add the rest of the sugar, and keep stirring until all the sugar has melted and 
            turned brown. Immediately pour the caramel into a bundt pan (about 22 cm in diameter), 
            and carefully rotate the pan as the caramel cools. 
            Make sure the whole bottom surface is covered; 
            you may need to use the spoon to spread the caramel. 
            (Tip: Be extremely careful; the hot caramel will make the bundt pan very hot. 
            Handle with caution.) Set aside to let cool.

            For the Flan: Add the remaining sugar and the vanilla to the center of a large bowl. 
            Warm the milk, and then add it to sugar. Stir well. 
            Add the eggs and stir gently with a whisk; 
            the eggs do not need to be beaten completely (see the photo above).
        </li>
        <li> 
            Pour the mixture into the caramelized bundt pan, and cover with foil. 
            Place this in a pan and fill with hot water until half the mold is covered with water. 
            Place the water bath in the oven, and bake at 320°F (160°C) for one hour. 
            After one hour, check the flan to make sure that it has set; 
            if not, cook it a little longer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the flan cool in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. 
            When ready, loosen the edges with a knife and flip onto a plate. 
            Make sure the plate has a lip to catch the caramel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve chilled with dulce de leche or whipped cream. Enjoy!
